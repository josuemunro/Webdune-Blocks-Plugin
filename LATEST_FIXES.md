**Version**: 1.0.1

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Reviews Marquee Save Error
**Problem**: "Could not update post in the database" when saving

**Cause**: The `photo` field was set to `null` in default values, which caused database serialization issues in WordPress.

**Fix**: Changed `null` to empty string `""` in:
- `src/blocks/reviews-marquee/block.json` - default review photos
- `src/blocks/reviews-marquee/edit.js` - new review creation

**Result**: Reviews marquee now saves successfully! ✅

---

### 2. ✅ Root Font Size / REM Scaling
**Problem**: All REM-based properties were way too small (root font was only 10px instead of viewport-scaled)

**Cause**: Missing the Webflow fluid typography system

**Fix**: Added viewport-based font scaling to `src/shared/typography.scss`:
```scss
html:not(.wp-admin) {
  font-size: calc(0.625rem + 0.41666666666666663vw);
  
  @media screen and (max-width: 1920px) {
    font-size: calc(0.625rem + 0.41666666666666674vw);
  }
  
  @media screen and (max-width: 1440px) {
    font-size: calc(0.8126951092611863rem + 0.20811654526534862vw);
  }
  
  @media screen and (max-width: 479px) {
    font-size: calc(0.7494769874476988rem + 0.8368200836820083vw);
  }
}
```

**Result**: Text sizes now scale properly based on viewport size! ✅

---

### 3. ✅ Editor Block Width Constraint
**Problem**: Blocks in the editor were constrained to 840px max-width, making full-width editing awkward

**Cause**: WordPress default editor styles

**Fix**: Added override in `src/shared/theme-overrides.scss`:
```scss
.editor-styles-wrapper {
  [class*="wp-block-webdune"] {
    max-width: none !important;
    
    &.alignfull {
      max-width: none !important;
      width: 100% !important;
    }
  }
  
  .wp-block {
    max-width: none !important;
  }
}
```

**Result**: Blocks now span full width in editor for better editing experience! ✅

---

### 4. ✅ Navigation Liquid Glass Effect
**Problem**: Navigation bar was missing the cool frosted glass/blur effect

**Cause**: Missing CSS backdrop-filter and pseudo-elements

**Fix**: Added to `src/blocks/navigation/style.scss`:
```scss
.navbar14_container {
  // Liquid glass effect - noise texture layer
  &::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    inset: 0;
    z-index: -2;
    border-radius: 28px;
    background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,..."); // Noise texture
    opacity: 0.05;
    pointer-events: none;
  }

  // Backdrop blur and distortion layer
  &::after {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    inset: 0;
    z-index: -1;
    border-radius: 28px;
    backdrop-filter: blur(6px);
    -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(6px);
    filter: url(#glass-distortion);
    -webkit-filter: url(#glass-distortion);
    pointer-events: none;
  }
}
```

**Note**: The SVG distortion filter was already in the save.js file, so it works automatically!

**Result**: Navigation now has that beautiful liquid glass effect! ✅

## 🐛 Reviews Marquee - Database Save Error FIXED (v1.0.1)

**Issue**: "Updating failed. Could not update post in the database."

**Root Cause**: Review IDs were inconsistent - defaults used `1, 2, 3` but new reviews used `Date.now()` timestamps. WordPress detected data type mismatches causing save failures.

**Fix**:
- Changed `addReview()` to generate sequential IDs matching the default format
- Uses `Math.max(...reviews.map(r => r.id))` to find highest ID and increment

**Result**: Reviews marquee now saves reliably! ✅

## 🐛 Phone Slider Debug Mode Added (v1.0.1)

### New: Comprehensive Debugging

The phone slider now includes detailed debugging information to help diagnose issues:

**What's New:**
1. **Browser Console Logging** - Detailed query information logged to console
2. **Visual Debug Panel** - Yellow warning panel shows on frontend when no posts found
3. **SQL Query Display** - See the actual database query being run
4. **Category/Post ID Validation** - Shows if selected categories or posts exist

**How to Use:**
1. Visit a page with the phone slider
2. Press `F12` to open browser console
3. Look for: `📱 Phone Slider Debug` section
4. Review the query args and SQL to see what's being queried

**Debug Info Includes:**
- Selection method (latest/category/manual)
- Query arguments sent to WordPress
- Number of posts found
- SQL query executed
- Category details (if using category filter)
- Post IDs (if using manual selection)

**Common Issues to Look For:**
- Category has 0 posts
- Selected posts are in draft status
- Query returns 0 results even with "latest" mode
- SQL query shows unexpected WHERE clauses
- **Block needs re-saving** after plugin update (dynamic blocks sometimes cache)

**If Phone Slider Still Not Showing:**
1. Check browser console for debug output
2. Re-save the page (edit mode → click Update)
3. Clear all caches (WP cache, object cache, browser cache)
4. Check WordPress error log for "Phone Slider render.php called"

See `PHONE_SLIDER_DEBUG.md` for detailed troubleshooting guide.
