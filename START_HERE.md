## 🎯 Current Goals & Workflow

### ✅ Development Workflow Established

**Source of Truth**: `sellmycell.webflow/` folder contains:
- `index.html` - Full homepage with all sections
- `how-it-works.html` - Interior page example
- `css/sellmycell.webflow.css` - All compiled styles
- `js/webflow.js` - Webflow interactions
- Custom styles in `<div class="custom-styles">` (nav liquid glass, underlines, etc.)
- Parallax/scroll scripts at end of HTML

**Block Building Process**:
1. Locate the section in `index.html` (each section = potential block)
2. Copy exact HTML structure
3. Extract relevant CSS from `sellmycell.webflow.css`
4. **IMPORTANT**: Convert Webflow CSS variables to SASS variables
   - `var(--white)` → `$color-white`
   - `var(--brick)` → `$color-brick`
   - See `src/shared/colors.scss` for all available SASS variables
5. Use existing shared styles (typography, colors, layout)
6. Mobile styles are already in the export - use them!
7. **Don't make up random CSS** - use what's in the export

### ✅ Completed Blocks (Ready to Use)
- [x] Navigation block (liquid glass effect)
- [x] Footer block (multi-column, newsletter)

## 🛠️ Required WordPress Plugins

### Must Have (Development)
1. **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) PRO** - For phone post fields
   - Free version OK for now, PRO has repeater fields
   - Install from: wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/

2. **Query Monitor** - Debugging (dev only)
   - Helps debug queries, hooks, performance
   - Install from: wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/

### Nice to Have (Development)
3. **WordPress Importer** - For importing phone posts later
4. **User Switching** - Switch between admin/editor easily
5. **Regenerate Thumbnails** - After adding custom image sizes

### Will Need Later (Production)
6. **Google Reviews Plugin** - TBD (Phase 2)
7. **WP Rocket** or similar - Caching (production only)

### DO NOT Install
- ❌ WP Bakery Page Builder (old system, not needed)
- ❌ Any page builder plugins (we're replacing these)
- ❌ Heavy SEO plugins yet (keep it light for dev)

## 📁 Folder Structure Setup

### Recommended Structure

```
E:\Josue Munro\Documents\Projects\WebDune\SellmyCell\
│
├── Webdune Blocks Plugin\          ← CURRENT FOLDER (Plugin source)
│   ├── src/
│   ├── includes/
│   ├── webdune-blocks.php
│   ├── package.json
│   └── [all documentation]
│
├── sellmycell-local\               ← FULL SITE (from All-in-One import)
│   └── [will be created later after 3hr export]
│
└── sellmycell-dev\                 ← NEW FRESH DEV SITE
    └── app\
        └── public\
            ├── wp-content\
            │   ├── plugins\
            │   │   └── webdune-blocks\  ← SYMLINK to plugin source
            │   └── uploads\             ← Copy downloaded media here
            ├── wp-config.php
            └── [WordPress files]
```

### Why This Structure?

1. **Plugin Source** (current folder) - This is your main development folder
2. **Fresh Dev Site** - Clean WordPress for initial block development
3. **Full Import Site** - Will have all real data once export completes

---

## 🔗 Setting Up Symlink (Recommended)

Instead of copying the plugin folder, create a **symlink** so changes sync automatically:

### Windows (Git Bash / Admin PowerShell)
```bash
# In Local site plugins directory
cd ~/Local Sites/sellmycell-dev/app/public/wp-content/plugins/

# Create symlink (Windows)
cmd //c mklink //D webdune-blocks "E:\Josue Munro\Documents\Projects\WebDune\SellmyCell\Webdune Blocks Plugin"
```

### Benefits
- Edit files in main plugin folder
- Changes automatically appear in Local site
- Don't duplicate files
- Same folder for both sites later

---

## 💻 Cursor Workspace Setup

### Option 1: Single Workspace (Recommended for Now)
Open just the **plugin folder** in Cursor:
```
E:\Josue Munro\Documents\Projects\WebDune\SellmyCell\Webdune Blocks Plugin
```

**Why**: You're only editing plugin files. WordPress core files you don't touch.

### Option 2: Multi-Root Workspace (Later, if needed)
Create `.code-workspace` file:
```json
{
  "folders": [
    {
      "name": "Plugin Source",
      "path": "E:\\Josue Munro\\Documents\\Projects\\WebDune\\SellmyCell\\Webdune Blocks Plugin"
    },
    {
      "name": "Dev Site Theme",
      "path": "C:\\Users\\[YOU]\\Local Sites\\sellmycell-dev\\app\\public\\wp-content\\themes\\[THEME-NAME]"
    }
  ]
}
```

**For now**: Stick with **Option 1**. You don't need to see WordPress core files.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### 1. Create Local Site
In Local by Flywheel:
- Site name: `sellmycell-dev`
- PHP: 8.0+
- Server: Nginx
- MySQL: 8.0

### 2. Set Up Plugin
```bash
# Navigate to Local site plugins folder
cd ~/Local Sites/sellmycell-dev/app/public/wp-content/plugins/

# Create symlink (or copy folder)
# [See symlink instructions above]

# Navigate to plugin
cd webdune-blocks

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development
npm start
```

### 3. Set Up ACF Fields (For Phone Search Later)
Don't worry about this yet, but when ready:
- Tools → Import Field Groups
- Import the JSON from client site
- Or manually create:
  - Field Group: "Phone Details"
  - Repeater: `capacity_groups`
  - Repeater: `condition_modifiers`
  - Number: `minimum_price`

### 4. Add Sample Phone Posts
Create 3-5 test posts:
- Title: "Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max"
- Add featured image (phone photo)
- Add ACF fields (capacity + conditions)
- Publish
